Lalia, cf. "glossolalia" pseudocode 

The basic idea is to create a software package that is perfected enough for use in general mobile devices, but also for use in dedicated 
portable and non-portable machines for this single purpose, with just the interals of a simple computer system-on-chip, a good microphone, 
and a clear display screen.

Those posessed by the Holy Spirit will deliver utterances which will be sensed by the machine, which will then translate speech to 
speech transcription text and then into coded messages, organized in database files (spreadsheets), as per the machine's pre-established 
programming. In order to thwart fraud and spoofing, the speech transcriptions and their target database output words and expressions 
can be scrambled, and the scramble which is used will have a visible code number, which is essential, given the need of the master glossolalist
know the way the machine is scrambling speech transcriptions and target database elements.
