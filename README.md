# Lalia

Lalia, cf. "glossolalia," software which incorporates a very generalized speech to text engine along with an editable spreadsheet system for transforming utterances by Holy prophets into actual meaningful speech or command language. Holy prophets are those who are in the receiving of quantum cognitive speech commands from the Holy Quantum God beings. Those faking such speech sounds would not be able to fool the machine into delivering meaningful code, as the transcribed sounds are scrambled in a way which no human can fake without prior training, and if the scrambles are sophisticated, even obnoxious attempts at fakery will fail, and even obnoxiously scrutinous tests will confirm actual receivers. 

The scrambles are best at first simply built, from simple shift cyphers and substitution cyphers, and on to where sounds are transcribed then scrambled on a sylallbic basis. The simple alphabet shift and substitution cyphers might be rather simplistic, but the simple syllablic shift and substitution cyphers might be more than ample for most uses! And each scramble has a associated identity code, which can (if in insecure environments) also be coded/scrambled/encrypted. 

The basic idea is to create a software package that is perfected enough for use in general mobile devices, but also for use in dedicated 
portable and non-portable machines for this single purpose, with just the interals of a simple computer system-on-chip, a good microphone, 
and a clear display screen. Those posessed by the Holy Spirit will deliver utterances which will be sensed acoustically by the machine through a microphone, which will then translate speech to speech transcription text and then into coded messages, organized in database files (spreadsheets), as per the machine's pre-established programming. 

Scrambles and deeper coded messages //

In order to thwart fraud and spoofing, the speech transcriptions and their target database output words and expressions 
can be and should be scrambled, and the scramble which is used will have a visible code number, which is essential, given the need of the master glossolalist know the way the machine is scrambling speech transcriptions and target database elements. The "scrambles" (ie. simple encryptions) can, with flexible programming of the spreadsheet or spreadsheets, be quite complex and deep, and therefore be akin to deep encryptions. But for the basic operation of this program, the scrambles don't need to be too complex, and in fact its important to build this software package, as with anything, from simple principles first. 

Speech to text/phonetic transcription code //

In the building of this program, the speech-to-text engine needs to do just one thing well, which is to recognize speech in the form of standard European, Asian, and African syllables, with a primary emphasis on European because these are distilled down to consonants and vowels, its vowel flexations are finite, its compound consonants are well-researched. Asian tonal vowels and African click-consonants can be added later. 

Thus a simple "scramble" resembles a Caesar cypher, where A -> B and B -> C etc. But for practical handling of speech, a transformation of 
[n + 1 (American English alphabet)] will create strange combinations which are not syllabic and therefore often not usefully linguistic. The word 
"cat" for example transcribed to American English alphabet letters is "cat" and then tranformed with [n + 1 (AE alphabet)] will print "dbu," which is itself not very useful. 

But n + 1 (alphabet) cyphers can be useful, but the code "dhu" for example or the next one "eiv," would have to then be understood as a casear cypher with backwards decryption, or else it would have to be assigned to some other pre-defined output, pre-coded into the output transform spreadsheet, like for example "dhu" could mean "the villain will be taking off her panties at night-dawn." And each of these elements could be coded too, for example "the villian" would have an understaood meaning (as for example "Heidegel ad Hunteringtonwroud") but that could also be encoded as something like "SURINAM" thereby hiding the two words "the villain" and therefore hding the idea that this codenamed object is anything but some anonymous person/actor/agent.

Speech to syllables transcription //

So cyphers are simplistic transformations for speech transcription purposes. The solution is to transcribe speech not into letters, exactly but syllables. This can be done with letters, with standard alphabets but then also with deeply resolute alphabets like the International Phonetic Alphabet, which has specific letters (or compound letters, "glyphs" is formal term) for each specific sound. For example it has fifteen vowel letters or "glyphs" and thirty-eight consonant glyphs for American English. Even the IPA system may not be sufficient for clear processing, but for the most part, a text to speech system that can accurately transcribe speech to the above fifty-three sounds will be highly useful. And any additional sound to speech handling can be helpful also, provvided the speech to text and the subsequent text to output code systems are well-built from simple and working (logic) principles up. 

For the speech to text engine to work, the discernment of syllables is important. Therefore the repudiation of the so called advanced linguistics idea that 'syllables don't actually exist,' has to be repudiated, and its easy to do. We know syllables to be the intersection between finite speech expressions and the prosody that gives the impression of separate and independent forms in speech forms where vowels and consnonants are used. ;-) And of course this is not to leave out speech where consonants and vowels are not used. Or, for that matter speech which has very complex forms of each. In the first case, consonants and vowels are used anyway, even if just as metaphors useful for approaching understanding of such language if any exist. And in the second case, complex forms are just variations on the simple. 

Human vocal capability is finite, making only a few hundred sounds at most. And anyway human "language" facility seems to like less complex bases for its physical mediaum, and even in the quantum realm, the mediaum is not of infinite symbolic resolution. 

The handling of speech in transcription means that prosody (speech tempo and rhythm) are important to be able to lay out transcribed speech well enough to then break apart the sounds into syllables and then transform these individually to some other syllables. 

Transcribing with prosody information included //

So in order for the speaker to say "cat" and have Lalia output the word "dog" (if that was what the transform scheme called for ahead of time), the word "cat" has to first be understood as a syllable |kat| with there being some need to handle the end consonant /t/ such that /kæ/ and /kæt/ are both handled as single syllables, and the end consonant /t/ is never confusing. 

The biology of speech and the good transcription of speech // 

There is a natural binding between writing and speech, which in transcription for mechanical parsing purposes needs to include time information. Humans speech conforms to several principles which are biological and rooted in bio-metabolism, the most notable being breath. Breathing has a rate, and that rate affects speech, but during normal speech, where the speaker is comfortable and able to speak without being rushed or interrupted, speech has a normal rate which is similar accross all humans.
