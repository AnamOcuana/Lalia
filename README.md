# Lalia
Lalia, cf. "glossolalia," software which incorporates a very generalized speech to text engine along with an editable spreadsheet system for transforming utterances by Holy prophets into actual meaningful speech or command language. Holy prophets are those who are in the receiving of quantum cognitive speech commands from the Holy Quantum God beings. Those faking such speech sounds would not be able to fool the machine into delivering meaningful code, as the transcribed sounds are scrambled in a way which has a associated identity code, and no human can fake. 

The basic idea is to create a software package that is perfected enough for use in general mobile devices, but also for use in dedicated 
portable and non-portable machines for this single purpose, with just the interals of a simple computer system-on-chip, a good microphone, 
and a clear display screen.

Those posessed by the Holy Spirit will deliver utterances which will be sensed acoustically by the machine through a microphone, which will then translate speech to speech transcription text and then into coded messages, organized in database files (spreadsheets), as per the machine's pre-established programming. In order to thwart fraud and spoofing, the speech transcriptions and their target database output words and expressions 
can be scrambled, and the scramble which is used will have a visible code number, which is essential, given the need of the master glossolalist
know the way the machine is scrambling speech transcriptions and target database elements. 

The "scrambles" (ie. simple encryptions) can, with flexible programming of the spreadsheet or spreadsheets, be quite complex and deep, and therefore be akin to deep encryptions. But for the basic operation of this program, the scrambles don't need to be too complex, and in fact its important to build it, as with anything, from simple principles first. In the building of this program, the speech-to-text engine needs to do just one thing well, which is to recognize speech in the form of standard European, Asian, and African syllables, with a primary emphasis on European because these are distilled down to consonants and vowels, its vowel flexations are finite, its compound consonants are well-researched. Asian tonal vowels and African click-consonants can be added later. 

Thus a simple "scramble" resembles a Caesar cypher, where A --> B and B --> C etc., except that the handling of speech in transcription means that prosody (speech tempo and rhythm) are important to be able to lay out transcribed speech well enough to then break apart the sounds into syllables and then transform these individually to some other syllables. 

So in order for the speaker to say "cat" and have Lalia output the word "dog" (if that was what the transform scheme called for ahead of time), the word "cat" has to first be understood as a syllable |kat| with there being some need to handle the end consonant /t/ such that /kæ/ and /kæt/ are both handled as single syllables, and the end consonant /t/ is never confusing.
