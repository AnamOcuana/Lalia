# Lalia
Lalia, cf. "glossolalia," software which incorporates a very generalized speech to text engine along with an editable spreadsheet system for transforming utterances by Holy prophets into actual meaningful speech or command language. Holy prophets are those who are in the receiving of quantum cognitive speech commands from the Holy Quantum God beings. Those faking such speech sounds would not be able to fool the machine into delivering meaningful code, as the transcribed sounds are scrambled in a way which has a associated identity code, and no human can fake. 

The basic idea is to create a software package that is perfected enough for use in general mobile devices, but also for use in dedicated 
portable and non-portable machines for this single purpose, with just the interals of a simple computer system-on-chip, a good microphone, 
and a clear display screen.

Those posessed by the Holy Spirit will deliver utterances which will be sensed by the machine, which will then translate speech to 
speech transcription text and then into coded messages, organized in database files (spreadsheets), as per the machine's pre-established 
programming. In order to thwart fraud and spoofing, the speech transcriptions and their target database output words and expressions 
can be scrambled, and the scramble which is used will have a visible code number, which is essential, given the need of the master glossolalist
know the way the machine is scrambling speech transcriptions and target database elements. 

The "scrambles" (ie. simple encryptions) can, with flexible programming of the spreadsheet or spreadsheets, be quite complex and deep, and therefore be akin to deep encryptions. But for the basic operation of this program, the scrambles don't need to be too complex, and in fact its important to build it, as with anything, from simple principles first. In the building of this program, the speech-to-text engine needs to do just one thing well, which is to recognize speech in the form of standard European, Asian, and African syllables, with a primary emphasis on European because these are distilled down to consonants and vowels, its vowel flexations are finite, its compound consonants are well-researched, and then
